Keep going – even the best programmers started out writing 'Hello World'!
Every bug you fix makes you a better developer!
The code you write today is better than the code you wrote yesterday!
Debugging is just being the detective in a crime movie where you're also the murderer!
It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature!
Code never lies, comments sometimes do!
There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things!
Talk is cheap. Show me the code!
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code!
Simplicity is the soul of efficiency!
Make it work, make it right, make it fast!
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand!
The best error message is the one that never shows up!
Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out!
Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad!
